# X
As I have no name for the matching algorithm I am using I am calling this function X.
X is a function that takes two vectors A and B such that |A|<|B|. The function then tries to match as much of A as possible onto B without reordering, but including missing out elements of B.

The function is calculated recursively and returns as list of possibilities.
